Answer some baseball trivia
Write code to answer some of the following questions:
1. What team had the highest number of home runs in a season?

2. What was the total attendance at all games in 1999?

3. What team had the lowest percentage of games won (i.e., games won / total games 
played) and also won the world series in a season?

4. What team had the highest percentage of games won but lost the world series in a 
season?

5. In what four seasons did all teams play the same number of games in the season? (For 
this question, you can use the fact that the data is ordered by year in the file to make 
the computation more efficient, or loop over the entire dataset for each year to find the 
data in a simpler but less efficient way.)

All of these questions require a loop over all the season results in all_data. Use the constants 
like HOME_RUN to index data from each season result.
